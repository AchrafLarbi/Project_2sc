## Overview

This project aims to create an intelligent traffic management system that can detect vehicles, estimate their speeds, identify speed violations, and dynamically adjust speed limits based on traffic conditions to optimize flow and safety. The system uses computer vision for vehicle detection, deep learning for license plate recognition, and reinforcement learning for dynamic speed limit control.

## Components

### Vehicle Detection and Tracking

Vehicle detection is implemented using YOLOv11, a state-of-the-art object detection model that provides accurate real-time detection:

- `ultralytics_example.py`: Example implementation of YOLOv11 for vehicle detection
- `detect.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for vehicle detection experiments
- Pre-trained models: `yolo11m.pt`, `yolo11n.pt`, and `best.pt` (fine-tuned for our specific use case)
- Integration with DeepSort for reliable vehicle tracking across video frames

### Speed Estimation and Violation Detection

Speed estimation is performed by tracking vehicles across frames and calculating their movement using perspective transformation and time-based calculations:

- `speed_plate_detector.py`: Main implementation that:
  - Tracks vehicles using DeepSort algorithm
  - Calculates real-world distances using perspective transformation
  - Detects speed violations based on configurable thresholds
  - Logs violations with timestamps and vehicle metadata
- `get_point_roi.ipynb`: Notebook for defining regions of interest for speed estimation
- `Detect_csv.py`: Implementation for validation and CSV output generation
- Virtual detection lines for precise speed measurement at specific points

### License Plate Recognition

The system can detect and recognize license plates for violation tracking using advanced OCR:

- `PlateDetection/`: Directory containing license plate detection and OCR components:
  - `app.py`: Main application for plate detection
  - `GeminiOcr.py`: License plate text recognition using Google's Gemini API
  - `Filter.py`: Image processing for better plate recognition including perspective correction
  - `Utils.py`: Utility functions for image handling and data processing
- Integration with the violation detection system to store evidence of speed violations

### Variable Speed Limit (VSL) System

An intelligent VSL system based on Deep Q-Network (DQN) Reinforcement Learning that learns optimal speed limits for different traffic conditions:

- `RLmodel_DQN.ipynb`: Implementation of the RL agent for Variable Speed Limit control, including:
  - Environment definition modeling traffic conditions
  - Deep Q-Network agent with neural network architecture
  - Reward function balancing traffic flow, safety, stability, and lane utilization
  - Training pipeline with exploration-exploitation strategy
  - Model evaluation and visualization tools
- Trained models: `models/vsl_best_model.weights.h5` and `models/vsl_final_model.weights.h5`
- Experimentation with different network architectures (default, 4-layer with ReLU, 4-layer with tanh)

### Traffic Data Analysis

Comprehensive analysis of traffic conditions and VSL system performance:

- `traffic_data.csv`, `traffic_data2.csv`: Traffic data samples with vehicle counts, speeds, and flow rates
- `TrafficData.py`: Traffic data processing utilities for pre-processing and feature extraction
- Visualization outputs:
  - `traffic_condition_analysis.png`: Analysis of traffic flow patterns
  - `vsl_results.png`: VSL system performance results
  - `model_analysis.png`: Comparison of different DQN model architectures
  - `vehicle_count_vs_speed_analysis.png`: Relationship between traffic density and speed

- `--show-vid`: Display the video during processing
- `--speed-limit`: Set custom speed limit (default: 50 km/h)

### Speed Estimation and Violation Detection

To detect speed violations and generate a CSV report:

```
python Detect_csv.py --source_video_path data/highway.mp4 --target_video_path output/result.mp4 --csv_output_path output/speeds.csv
```

Parameters:

- `--source_video_path`: Path to input video
- `--target_video_path`: Path for output video with visualizations
- `--csv_output_path`: Path for speed data CSV output

### License Plate Recognition

Run the license plate detection and recognition:

```
python PlateDetection/app.py --image_path violations/vehicle_123.jpg
```

### Variable Speed Limit (VSL) System

   ```
   jupyter notebook RLmodel_DQN.ipynb
   ```

   ```

2. Training a new VSL model:

   - Run the notebook cells in order
   - Adjust hyperparameters as needed in the `DQNAgent` class
   - The training results will be saved to the `models/` directory

   - Run the evaluation cells to visualize the model's performance
   - Compare different model architectures using the visualization tools

4. Testing the VSL system on new data:
   ```python
   # Inside the notebook
   data = load_traffic_data("new_traffic_data.csv")
   timestamps, recommended_speeds, actual_speeds, rewards = evaluate_vsl_agent(data, agent)
   visualize_results(timestamps, recommended_speeds, actual_speeds, rewards, data=data)
